---
Mount & Blade Warband Server GUI is just that a UI created to help start/run Mount & Blade Warband servers without having to created seperate config files etc.. It is very much still in development but should contain the following list of features when done.

- Launch any Module that is out there for Mount & Blade Warband
- Allow for any setting that uses the "Set" command via the .exe
